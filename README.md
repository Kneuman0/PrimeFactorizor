#Prime Factorizor

- This application is theoretically capable of breaking any number down to it's prime factors.
The application runs off a text document containing prime numbers. This document is over 1.5 GB which is why it
is not included in this repositiory. The text document contains sufficient number sizes to factor any number
that can be stored in a long datatype. All numbers containing primes larger than those in the text document
will be factored using an algorithm that will continue to find larger primes but should be expected to take a while.

- This application can also create it's own text document containing prime numbers. This process will take ~3 hours depending on computing power
